# Instagram Share Implementation Summary

## Overview
The Instagram share feature has been enhanced to include movie links and support URL parameters for displaying specific movies when users click on shared links.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. URL Parameter Handling
- The app now checks for `?movie={movieId}` parameter on load
- If a movie ID is found in the URL, that specific movie is fetched and displayed
- If no movie ID is found, the app loads a random movie as usual

### 2. Instagram Story Card with Links
- Story cards now include the movie link at the bottom: `whichmovieto.watch?movie={movieId}`
- The link is displayed in a contrasting color (#4ecdc4) for visibility
- Both story cards (1080x1920) and square cards (1080x1080) include the link

### 3. Enhanced Share Functionality
- When sharing to Instagram, the story card image is copied to clipboard
- After a short delay, the movie link text is also copied to clipboard
- Users get notifications about successful copying
- Fallback: If clipboard copying fails, the image is downloaded

### 4. Meta Tags Update
- Meta tags are automatically updated with movie-specific information
- URL in the browser is updated to include the movie ID
- This ensures proper sharing across all platforms
