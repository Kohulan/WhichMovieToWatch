PLACEHOLDER - Design your cinematic studio scene in Spline (app.spline.design) and export as .splinecode to replace this file.

Steps:
1. Open app.spline.design and create a new project
2. Model film equipment props: clapperboard, film reel, movie camera, director chair, spotlights
3. Add floating movie poster objects with atmospheric haze
4. Configure camera states and variables for route transitions (Plan 07-04)
5. File > Export > Code (.splinecode)
6. Replace this file with the exported .splinecode file

The SplineScene component will log a warning when it encounters this placeholder
and gracefully show the gradient blob fallback instead.
